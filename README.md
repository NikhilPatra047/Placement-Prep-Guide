# Placement-Prep

The most important element in cracking a Software Engineering Interview is Data Structures and Algorithms. GeeksforGeeks is by far the best place to study Data Structures and Algorithms (acc. to me). <br>
 
Checkout https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/?query=DSA for the courses they offer. Their tutorials and practice tracks are more than sufficient to prepare Data Structures and Algorithms. Sandeep Jain (CEO and founder of GeeksforGeeks) is teaching in DSA tutorials. Mr. Shashi Bhushan (Ex. SDE at Adobe and Paytm) is available in clearing all your doubts on discussion forum and their Disqus Portal. <br>

<p> Some of the benefits of practicing on above portal is that:
	1. One could end up in top 50 in your University Ranks and this stats are CV stuff.
	2. You can come across topics that are not published on G4G and publish yourself.
	3. If published, can end up with a stipend based internship opportunity at G4G.

<h2>Last Minute Material</h2>

1. Maintain notes from all above mentioned tutorials and that could be your best last minute materials.
2. <b> For Operating Systems: </b> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/last-minute-notes-operating-systems/<br>
3. <b> For Database Management Systems: </b> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/last-minute-notes-dbms/ <br>
4. <b> For Networks and Communication: </b> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/last-minute-notes-computer-network/ <br>
5. <b> For SQL Queries: </b> https://artoftesting.com/interviewSection/sql-queries-for-interview.html </br>

<h2>Tips</h2>

1. Start by picking up one programming language which you would like to code in, preferable (C++, Java for Data Structues)
   and could be (Python, C++, Java for Problem Solving). <br>
2. Gain minimum of 5 Stars in Problem Solving tab in Hackerrank. It will make your command strong over how to implement logics 
   and on a particular programming language as well. <br>
3. Do practice MCQs on all the topics if you go with DSA Track on G4G. <br>
